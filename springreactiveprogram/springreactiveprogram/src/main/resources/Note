in repositry if we want to create any method then this is way 
     Flux<Product> findByDescription(String desc);-->here description is entaty member so we mention D in camel case 
     if we have price then we can write in repo 
     Flux<Product> findByPrice(int price );
     
     ==================
     recative program means its non blocking and assynchronize program 
     -->here main thread doesnot wait for response 
     reactive program work on publicer and sebscriber 
     Mono<Any type >----> it can return 0 and 1 data so it internally call one and two time next method 
     Flux<Any type >---> it can return 0 or N data so it internally call one and N time data next method to get data 
     ======================================================================
     Project Reactor is a fully non-blocking reactive programming foundation for the JVM. It provides two main types:

Mono<T> – Emits 0 or 1 item.

Flux<T> – Emits 0 to N items (a stream of data).

========================================================
Reactive application can not run on appachi tomcat--netty is run on netty server
